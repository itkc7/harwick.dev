export const aboutText = `Hi! I’m Kyle Harwick, a recent University of Pittsburgh undergraduate with a bachelor’s in science in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID), with a minor in Japanese Studies. DNID combines the narrative, world-building, creative elements of the English department with the coding, technical, software parts of the School of Computing and Informatics to allow for a better understanding of the intricacies of interactivity and narrative by implementing these in embedded computational systems. My interests focus on UX/UI and web development, and I have experience in frontend, backend, and overall full stack development. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, React Native, Next.js, and Java, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn new and exciting programming languages. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching and playing soccer, listening to music, reading and traveling. Please take a look at my site and feel free to reach out on LinkedIn, Discord, or even shoot me an email!`;
